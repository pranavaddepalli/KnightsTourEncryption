## KnightsTourEncryption
A small project for exploring the Knight's Tour problem in Java and its application to encryption.

## The Knight's Tour Problem
A Knight's Tour is a series of moves by the Knight on a chess board such that the Knight is able to reach every square exactly once. Finding this series of moves constitutes the Knight's Tour Problem, and the solution depends on the starting position of the knight.

## This project
Running "run.java" will start the program. It will randomly choose a starting row and column on a chess board and use those values to solve the Knight's Tour problem for the board. The order of the moves made are used to encrypt a given text. The starting row, column, and text are printed for storage and later use (in decrypting).
